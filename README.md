# Error 404 – Dynamic Tiled Pop‑Ups

A playful and interactive 404 error page that:

- Splits your screen into four separate pop‑up windows.
- Animates each window into its quadrant with a smooth, bouncy effect.
- Dynamically updates each window’s view as you move or resize it.
- Closes the main window once the pop‑ups are created.
